    <h4> Anime: </h4>
<!--    talking about the hobby-->
    <p>      I've been watching anime for about a year and a half. I started by watching Naruto, and then I quit anime and started reading the manga instead. I like reading manga because a lot of the time the anime is way worse than the manga, and one episode of an anime encompasses about 3 to 4 chapters of a manga, and that takes 20 minutes to watch, but I can read that much in about half that.</p>

    <h4> Video Games: </h4>
<!--    talking about the second hobby-->
    <p>     Ever since I was young, I have liked playing video games. The earliest video game I remember playing would be Poptropica. I like playing video games because it fills up a lot of my time and I have fun doing it.</p>

<!--    review of manga above-->
    <p>I read the oneshot of this manga, and I absolutely loved it. I read all the translated chapters so far, and this manga is going in a great direction. The author is wasting no time with the story and instead of using Magic: The Gathering as a crutch, the author is going above and beyond in adding drama in a genre where I thought it would be impossible. Not to mention that it is a romantic-comedy manga, and I am a sucker for those.</p>

<!--    review of manga above-->
    <p> Kaguya-sama so far has been terrific. If you were to compare it to a bowl of ice cream, it would look like this: the actual ice cream is the comedy, and there is a whole ton of that, the sprinkles on top is fluff (and there is a healthy dose of that), and the cherry on top is the miniscule amount of drama within the manga.</p>
